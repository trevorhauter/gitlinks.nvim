## ê©œ Installation
- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{ 'trevorhauter/gitportal.nvim' }
```

## ê©œ Basic setup
Here is how I have gitportal currently set up
```lua
local gitportal = require("gitportal.core")

-- In normal mode, `open_file_in_browser()` opens the current file in your browser on the correct branch/commit.
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>gp", function() gitportal.open_file_in_browser() end)

-- In visual mode, `open_file_in_browser()` behaves the same but it also includes the selected line(s) in the permalink.
vim.keymap.set("v", "<leader>gp", function() gitportal.open_file_in_browser() end)

-- open_file_in_neovim accepts a github link, switches to the correct branch/commit, and opens the specified file.
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ig', function()
    gitportal.open_file_in_neovim(vim.fn.input("Github link > "));
end) 

```
